The "Tabsy" Chrome extension does not collect any user data nor share it with anyone, and it never will.
I wrote it because I couldn't find an extension that had the features I wanted and that didn't grant
itself more permissions than necessary.

Tabsy has to have access to the URLs and title of the tabs in your browser window in order to copy
them to the clipboard, which is its core functionality.

It also requires access to the "contextMenus" API to allow you to choose the format of the copied
links (HTML or Markdown).

It doesn't send data anywhere other than the clipboard, and it doesn't use any external sites or services.
